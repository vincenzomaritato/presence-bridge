# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The latest release and the `main` branch are supported for security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not open public issues for sensitive vulnerabilities.

Please report privately to project maintainers with:
- Affected version/commit
- Reproduction steps
- Impact assessment
- Suggested remediation (if known)

You will receive acknowledgment as soon as possible, and we will coordinate disclosure after a fix is available.
